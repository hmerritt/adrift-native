# Adrift Native

[Adrift](https://github.com/hmerritt/adrift) is a template for React apps with batteries included.

Adrift Native can run your apps _natively_ as a Windows, Linux and/or MacOS app (outside the browser as a standalone app).

Initial binary size (for Windows) is less-than 10MB, and as low as **3MB** when compressed with [upx](https://upx.github.io/).

## Features

-   ‚ö° [Wails](https://wails.io/) template - build cross-platform native apps with Go + WebView
-   üåä [Adrift](https://github.com/hmerritt/adrift) template for frontend
-   üèãÔ∏è CI/CD ([Github Actions](./.github/workflows/build.yml)) to test, compile, and release for Windows, Linux, and MacOS

## Getting started

**_Quick start_**, get up an running in one command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmerritt/adrift-native && cd adrift-native && go install github.com/magefile/mage && mage -v bootstrap && mage -v build
```

1.  Install Wails dependencies ([detailed instructions here](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation))

    -   [`go-lang`](https://go.dev/dl/)
    -   [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
    -   (Optional) [`nsis` windows installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/)
    -   (Optional) [`upx` compress binary](https://upx.github.io/)

2.  Clone this repo
3.  Install dependencies
    -   `go install github.com/magefile/mage`
    -   `mage -v bootstrap`
4.  Build the app with `mage -v build`

## Scripts

Scripts are written in Go, and ran using the [mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage) command.

Available scripts (`mage -l` for script list):

-   `bootstrap` - installs required dependencies (aims to be an all-in-one setup script)
-   `test` - runs all Go test files
-   `dev` - starts up dev server with live hot-reloading
-   `build` - builds production binaries to `bin` directory

## Electron? - Nope!

[wails.io](https://wails.io) - Build beautiful cross-platform applications using Go.

Wails relies on WebView:

-   Less memory usage
-   Smaller binary size (<10MB)
-   Written in Go (Go is a better language for native apps from JS, and easier to work with than C/C++/Rust)
