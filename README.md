# Adrift Native

[Adrift](https://github.com/hmerritt/adrift) is a template for React apps with batteries included.

Adrift Native can run your apps _natively_ as a Windows and Mac app (outside the browser as a standalone app).

Initial binary size (for Windows) is less-than **10MB**!

## Getting started

Quickstart by building the app yourself:

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd frontend`
3. `yarn install` (or `npm install`)
4. `yarn build` (or `npm run build`)
5. `cd ..`
6. `wails build`

[Detailed build instructions here](build/README.md)
