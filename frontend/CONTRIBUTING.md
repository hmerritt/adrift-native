# Contributing

#1 Rule. Try to write good code; no worries if not.

## Commit rules

### Commit message

A good commit message should describe what changed and why.

It should:

-   contain a short description of the change (preferably 50 characters or less)
-   be entirely in lowercase with the exception of proper nouns, acronyms, and the words that refer to code, like function/variable names
-   be prefixed with one of the following word:
    -   `fix` : bug fix
    -   `hotfix` : urgent bug fix
    -   `feat` : new or updated feature
    -   `refactor` : code refactoring (no functional change)
    -   `test` : tests updates
    -   `ci` : ci and build updates
    -   `chore` : miscellaneous housekeeping updates
    -   `Merge branch` : when merging branch
    -   `Merge pull request` : when merging PR

## Tests

Tests are using the [`Vitest`](https://vitest.dev) framework.

```
yarn test
```

### Test tips

A few tips to write better tests:

[Russ Cox - Go Testing By Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-o-iJlL4ak)

-   Make it easy to add new tests.
-   Use test coverage to find untested code.
-   Coverage is no substitute for thought.
-   Write exhaustive tests.
-   Separate test cases from test logic (i.e use test case tables, separate from logic).
-   Look for special cases.
-   If you didn't add a test, you didn't fix the bug.
-   Test cases can be in testdata files.
-   Compare against other implementations.
-   Make test failures readable.
-   If the answers can change, wtite coed to update them.
-   Code quality is limited by test quality.
-   Scripts make good test cases.
-   Improve your tests over time.

## Formatting

Formatting is handled by [`Prettier`](https://prettier.io).

Rules are defined in `.prettierrc.json`.

Make sure your editor is configured to use Prettier!
